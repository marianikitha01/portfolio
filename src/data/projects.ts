    title: 'Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery',
    description: 'Developed a machine learning model to predict equipment failure, reducing downtime by 20%.',
    longDescription: 'This project involved analyzing sensor data from industrial machines to identify patterns preceding failures. Utilized LSTM networks for time-series forecasting and deployed the model as a microservice. The solution helped optimize maintenance schedules and significantly cut operational costs.',
